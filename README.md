### What I learned

In this project, I was able to learn how to use the Tailwind CSS framework, as well as the Shadcn ui components library.

### Useful resources

- [Watching Tailwind tutorials is a waste of time](https://youtu.be/Ksn1tThNTjI?si=KpeU1hqj9Lws_zF_) - Thisvideo helped me save hours of tutorials on using tailwind css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [How to install Shadcn ui with React js](https://youtu.be/gXSC5eMw68o?si=rgmKdGII5h4TapnC) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand how to configure the Shadcn UI for my react js app. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this issue.
